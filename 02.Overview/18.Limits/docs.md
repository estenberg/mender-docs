This section gives an overview over important resource limits that help ensure the health and security of the Mender Server.

## Polling interval: Update checks
The frequency with which a Device checks for updates.

Default for Mender Client: `1800 seconds` (30 minutes)</br>
Default for Mender MCU Client: `86400 seconds` (1 day)</br>

This is a Client side configuration, see [Mender Client configuration](../../03.Client-installation/07.Configuration/01.Polling-intervals/docs.md),
and [Mender MCU Client configuration](../../06.Operating-System-updates-Zephyr/04.Customize-Mender-mcu/docs.md).

! Warning: Using *shorter* than default intervals with hosted Mender is considered *excessive use* and may trigger rate limiting,
! unless it is 10 devices or less for trial/testing or otherwise agreed upon in advance.

## Polling interval: Inventory updates
The frequency a Device can update its current inventory to the Mender Server.

Default for Mender Client: `28800 seconds` (8 hours)</br>
Default for Mender MCU Client: `1209600 seconds` (14 days)</br>

This is a Client side configuration, see [Mender Client configuration](../../03.Client-installation/07.Configuration/01.Polling-intervals/docs.md),
and [Mender MCU Client configuration](../../06.Operating-System-updates-Zephyr/04.Customize-Mender-mcu/docs.md).

! Warning: Using *shorter* than default intervals with hosted Mender is considered *excessive use* and may trigger rate limiting,
! unless it is 10 devices or less for trial/testing or otherwise agreed upon in advance.

### Maximum size of Artifact uploads
The maximum size of pre-built Mender Artifacts that can be uploaded to the Mender Server.

Default: `10 GiB`</br> 
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `DEPLOYMENTS_STORAGE_MAX_IMAGE_SIZE`

### Maximum size of single file uploads
The maximum size of single-file type Artifacts generated by the Mender Server with the [Generate Artifact endpoint](https://docs.mender.io/api/#management-api-deployments-generate-artifact).

Default: `256 MiB`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `DEPLOYMENTS_STORAGE_MAX_GENERATE_DATA_SIZE`

### Maximum total size of Device inventory
The maximum size of a single Device inventory on the Mender Server. This limit is based on the maximum size of a BSON document in MongoDB, but there are other limits that can limit this further.

Default: `10 MiB`</br>
Overriding this limit is not possible

### Maximum length of Release names
The maximum length of Release names when creating Releases on the Mender Server.

Default: `256 characters`</br>
Overriding this limit is not possible

### Maximum length of Mender Configure strings
The maximum length of keys and values in Mender Configure Device attributes.

Default: `4096 characters`</br>
Overriding this limit is not possible

### Maximum number of active deployments
The maximum number of active and pending deployments per tenant.

Default: `No limit`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `DEPLOYMENTS_LIMIT_MAX_ACTIVE_DEPLOYMENTS`

! Warning: This limit is set to **800** active deployments per tenant on hosted Mender.

### Maximum number of tags per Device
The maximum number of tags that can be defined per Device inventory.

Default: `20`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `INVENTORY_LIMIT_TAGS`

### Maximum size of server-side delta Artifact
The maximum uncompressed size of the root file system in Mender Artifacts that you can use to trigger server-side binary delta generation.

Default: `5 GiB`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `DEPLOYMENTS_SERVER_SIDE_DELTA_GENERATION_MAX_ARTIFACT_SIZE_MB`
Note that the environment variable is represented in **MiB**, and its default value is `5120`.
